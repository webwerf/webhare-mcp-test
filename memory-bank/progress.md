## Known Issues

1. **Path Handling**
   - The WebHare CLI path is hardcoded in the configuration
   - May need to be updated for different environments
   - No automatic detection of WebHare installation

2. **Error Handling**
   - Error messages could be more specific and helpful
   - Some edge cases may not be properly handled
   - No detailed logging for debugging

3. **Performance**
   - Command execution may be slow for complex operations
   - No caching mechanism for frequently accessed resources

4. **Compatibility**
   - Not tested with all WebHare versions
   - May have issues with certain WebHare configurations

## Next Steps

1. **Test with Local WebHare Installation**
   - Validate functionality with the actual WebHare installation
   - Identify and fix any issues

2. **Improve Error Handling**
   - Add more specific error types
   - Improve error messages
   - Implement better logging

3. **Enhance Documentation**
   - Add more detailed usage examples
   - Document common error scenarios and solutions
   - Create a troubleshooting guide

4. **Plan for Advanced Features**
   - Research WebHare API integration
   - Design module management tools
   - Plan for user management features
